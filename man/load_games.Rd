Pull in all college basketball games tracked by collegebasketballdata.com

Returns data for all NCAA D1 men's basketball games for the specified seasons. Includes contextual information, such as where the game took place and who it is between, as well as high level box score data, such as the scores of each team.

This will return both games in the past and scheduled games. If a game is scheduled but its opponents have not yet been determined (i.e., the national championship game of the upcoming season), it will not appear in this dataset.
